A project to bring something like "Silk" to every platform that I started January 2012

When I started this project in 2012 I was still doing WCF and WPF (pre-mvvm), but the idea was to create Windows Phone and Linux versions at the very least, eventually leading to a C++ version to run on my Silicon Graphics machines which sadly don't run Mono.
